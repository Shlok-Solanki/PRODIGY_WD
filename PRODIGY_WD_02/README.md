# ⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application – by Shlok Solanki

A clean, accessible, and fully functional stopwatch built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was created as part of my Web Development Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I focused on building responsive, interactive frontend applications.

## 📌 About the Project

This stopwatch application allows users to:
- Start, pause/resume, and reset a timer
- Record lap times with automatic lap numbering
- Use keyboard shortcuts for a faster experience

> This project helped me sharpen my **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **accessibility** practices using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
